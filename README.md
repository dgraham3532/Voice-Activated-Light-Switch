Code for controlling a servo motor to rotate 180* to push/pull a light switch into the on/off position via voice commands.

Use the vr_sample_train.ino arduino file to train your microphone module to detect specific activation commands. 

using these commands, we then alter the arduino's state, as seen within the LightSwitch.ino file.
